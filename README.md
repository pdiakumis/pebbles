# umccr.facets.gc

* __NOTE:__ This is a modified version of <https://github.com/veseshan/pctGCdata>,
  where I've simply deleted the mouse and hg18 genomes for convenience and speed.
* Contains R datasets of GC percentages for human genomes.
* Provides the data needed to GC normalize tumor-normal log-ratio.
Package facets (<https://github.com/veseshan/facets>) depends on it.
